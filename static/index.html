		<h3>What's my take on this lab?</h3>
		<p>Well, it was definitely <strong>packed</strong> with information.</p>
		<p>Learning all that CSS was capable of, with a basic introduction to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html">frameworks</a>, was a lot to handle in a little over an hour.</p>
		<p>Especially when there was a huge disparity in lab progress throughout the class, evidenced by the many 
			<code>heroku: command not found</code>'s, 
			but we were mostly just told, 
			<blockquote>Okay, we're gonna just move on now, why don't we all just clear our post-its...<small>Michael Bernstein</small></blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>To be honest, it seemed like the small group of people that <em>weren't</em> having trouble with heroku, vagrant, etc. were already way ahead of where Prof. Bernstein was by looking at the slides, and those who were still waiting for <code>vagrant up</code> were left in the dust... Unclear what proportion of the class were actually on pace with Prof. Bernstein... certainly no one around me.</p>
		<p>Another question, <strong>when are the labs posted?</strong></p> I ask this because, although well-intentioned, it seems labs quickly spiral out of control with unforeseen issues, inherently time-taking activities (see <code>vagrant up</code>), and general confusion with concepts like CSS, version control, just what the heck a repository is, and the like. I can't imagine next week with client-side interactive javascript!</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">A <strong>possible solution</strong> would be to post the labs 24 hours in advance and allow the time allocated for "lab" on Wednesdays to be a massive help session. In theory, those who haven't started can come and finish the lab in the time allocated, and those who are ahead can get the specific help they need. And most improtantly, it probably wouldn't be any more chaotic as it is right now.</div> 
		<p>That way, things like <code>heroku: command not found</code> could be dealt on Piazza - a forum that's meant to find common problems and rectify them on a public scale so the TA's don't have to go around individually telling people, "Well a lot of people are running into that problem so the TAs have decided to..." This is the exact problem Piazza was meant to solve!</p>
		<p>Further, things that take a lot of time and bandwidth, like <code>vagrant halt</code> and <code>vagrant up</code> and even forking the repository, could be done outside of <abbr title="Annenberg Auditorium, across from the quad, next to Cubberly Auditorium">AnnAud</abbr>. </p>
		<p><span class="label label-danger">Just to be clear</span> I'm really not trying to backseat TA, you guys just seemed a little rattled today. And I can't blame you - 350 kids all having individual issues, many of them annoying and strange problems relating to setting up the environment (I maintain these types of problems are the worst), can't be easy to deal with.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>By the way, </strong> I got Heroku to work by typing <strong><a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/debian">this</a></strong> <code>wget</code> command.</div>

		<h4 class="pull-right">Just thought I'd try out the stretch goal with a little bit of actual content...</h4>
